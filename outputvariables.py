# output variables


# In python print() function is used often to output variables.

x = " python"
print(x)



#In the print() function your output multiple variables seperated by comma

x = "python"
y="machine Learning"
z="AI"
print(x,y,z)


# you can use + symbol to output multiple variables

x = "python"
y="machine Learning"
z="AI"
print(x+y+z)



# for numbers + operator works as mathematical operator

x = 5
y = 10
print(x+y)


# python will throw an error if you try to add a string and number with + operator

'''x = 5

y = "String "
print(x+y)'''

# the best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to seperate them with comma , which even support different data types.

x = 5
y="Machine learning"
print(x,y)
